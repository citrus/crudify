Crudify
=======

A dynamic resource controller for Rails 3 that keeps your controllers nice and skinny.

Crudify was shamelessly robbed from [refinerycms](https://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/blob/master/core/lib/refinery/crud.rb)'s internals and customized for use in other projects. Much credit and many thanks to the guys at [resolve digital](http://resolvedigital.com/) for all their hard work on the [refinery cms project](http://resolvedigital.com/development/refinery%C2%A0cms). Keep it up!

NOTE: While taken from Refinery CMS, please note that this plugin contains some additional functionality not present in Refinery CMS's version of `crudify`, so you'll probably want to refer to their documentation or source code for `crudify` if you're working on a Refinery CMS project.


Installation
------------

It's best to install crudify by adding your Rails 3 project's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "http://rubygems.org"
gem 'rails',   '>= 3.0.0'
gem 'crudify', '>= 0.0.7'
```

Now run:

    bundle install


Usage
-----

In its most basic form, crudify is designed to be use like this:

```ruby
class JelliesController < ApplicationController
  crudify :jelly
end
```


Ok, so what does it do? The short answer; _everything_ that you'd want it to. In more detail, crudify turns your controller into a full-fledged CRUD controller with `index`, `new`, `create`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, and `destroy`. But wait, there's more! Inside each of these standard methods are several _hook methods_ designed to make customizing your controllers even easier that overwriting crudify's methods. Overwriting; say what? ...

Say you want to customize an action that's being defined by crudify, simply overwrite it!

```ruby
class JelliesController < ApplicationController
  crudify :jelly

  def create
    @jelly = Jelly.new(params[:jelly])
    # ... the rest of your custom action
  end
end
```


Ok that seems easy enough, but what if my action is just a tiny bit different? That's where the _hook methods_ come in...

### Hook Methods

Laced into crudify's actions are a module full of methods designed to make customizing your controller quick and simple. Let's examine these methods in further detail starting with create.

Here's what lines #45-59 in `lib/crudify/class_methods.rb` will produce in our Jellies controller:

```ruby
def create
  # if the position field exists, set this object as last object, given the conditions of this class.
  if Jelly.column_names.include?("position")
    params[:jelly].merge!({
      :position => ((Jelly.maximum(:position, :conditions => "")||-1) + 1)
    })
  end
  @instance = @jelly = Jelly.new(params[:jelly])
  before_create
  if @instance.valid? && @instance.save
    successful_create
  else
    failed_create
  end
end
```


Just before the calls to `valid?` and `save`, you'll see `before_create`; the first hook method in the action. Looking further into the source, `before_create` is nothing more than a blank action, waiting to be overwritten:

```ruby
def before_create
  # just a hook!
  puts "> Crud::before_create" if @crud_options[:log]
  before_action
end
```

Notice that `before_create` calls a second hook; `before_action`. This is a generic hook that fires before every crud method's call to `save`, `update` or `destroy`. This means it might be helpful for you to call `super` when overwriting this method so that the chain of hooks keeps firing. Inside the `before_action` method we'll decide what to use as flash messages with `set_what`. Here's the code for `before_action`:

```ruby
def before_action
  # just a hook!
  puts "> Crud::before_action" if @crud_options[:log]
  set_what
  true
end
```


*Ok Ok, so we're gettin' kind of deep here.* Let's get back to the basic concept; Skinny, sexy and easy on the eyes. (Are we still talking ruby here?)

Here's an example of a `before_create` hook:

```ruby
class InquiriesController < ApplicationController
  crudify :inquiry

  def before_create
    @inquiry.ip_address = request.remote_addr
    super
  end

end
```


And a `successful_create` hook:

```ruby
class InquiriesController < ApplicationController
  crudify :inquiry

  def successful_create
    InquiryMailer.message(@inquiry).deliver!
    super
  end

end
```

Testing
-------

Shoulda and Capybara/Selenium tests can be run by cloning the repo and running `rake`:

    git clone git://github.com/citrus/crudify.git
    cd crudify
    bundle install
    rake


To Do
-----

There's a few things to be done still...

* Tests for search
* More Documentation & Examples
* Nested set tests and demo (haven't even tried this yet :/)
* Generally more thorough tests
* Refactoring/Optimizing
